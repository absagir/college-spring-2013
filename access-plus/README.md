Access Plus Scripts
===================

These are scripts that automate the adding of classes using [Python][python],
[Firefox][firefox], and the [Selenium Web Driver][driver].

## WARNING: Use at your own risk.

Iowa State has a system in place that detects excessive page reloads and tries
to stop the automatic adding of classes. It will block you out of
[AccessPlus][a+] and you'll have to contact the Registrar to have your account
unblocked.

I am not responsible for any trouble you may get in while using this.
