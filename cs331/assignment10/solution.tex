\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Let \(G\) be a undirected and connected graph.
    \\

    Prove that \(EULERIAN-PATH = \{\langle G \rangle : G \mbox{ has an Eulerian
    path}\}\) is in \(P\).

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(EULERIAN-PATH\) is in \(P\), we will first prove that
        \(G\) has an Eulerian path iff every vertex in \(G\) has an even number
        degree. Then we will use this fact to create a TM to show that
        \(EULERIAN-PATH\) is in \(P\). We break up the first task into two
        parts.
        \\

        \textbf{Part One} If \(G\) has an \(EULERIAN-PATH\), then every vertex
        has an even degree.
        \\

        This is easy to prove, for every node \(v \in G\), in order to visit
        every edge only once, whenever we visit a node on an unused edge, there
        must be an accompanying unused edge to let us leave the node. This also
        applies to the very first/last node in the path. One edge must be used
        to leave it at the start of the path and one edge must be used to exit
        onto it at the end of the path.
        \\

        Thus if a graph \(G\) has an \(EULERIAN-PATH\), then every vertex has
        an even degree because we need to enter it by an unused edge and leave
        it by an unused path.
        \\

        \textbf{Part Two} If every vertex has an even degree, then \(G\) has an
        \(EULERIAN-PATH\).
        \\

        To show this, we will use a proof by induction.
        \\

        \textbf{Base Case} We consider the two base cases: one graph with one
        vertex, and one graph with three vertices.
        \\

        Consider the base case with just one vertex. Since there are zero edges,
        zero is an even number and thus a single vertex is an Eulerian path to
        itself.
        \\

        Next consider the base case with three vertices connected by an edge between
        all of them. Since there are three edges and three vertices, the graph
        is in the form of a triangle. If we count the degree for each vertex we
        can see that the number equals two for all three vertices. Thus it
        holds for the base case.
        \\

        \textbf{Induction Step} We now consider a graph \(G\) with \(n\)
        vertices and \(k\) edges. We wish to show that a graph with \(n\)
        vertices and \(k + 1\) edges has an Eulerian path.
        \\

        According to the definition, \(G\) is connected and each vertex has an even
        degree.


        Now we will show that \(EULERIAN-PATH\) is in \(P\) by constructing a
        TM \(M\) that runs in polynomial time.
        \\

        Since we have constructed a TM that runs in polynomial time,
        \(EULERIAN-PATH\) is in \(P\) and our proof is complete.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Let \(TSP = \{ \langle G, K \rangle : G \mbox{ has a Hamiltonian path of
    length less than } k\}\).
    \\

    Prove that \(TSP\) is \(NP\)-complete.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(TSP\) is \(NP\)-complete, we will show that \(HAMPATH
        \leq_p TSP\). This will show that \(TSP\) is \(NP-complete\) based on
        \textbf{Theorem 7.36}.
        \\

        First we will show that \(TPS \in NP\). This is easy because we can
        easily construct a verifier that given a certificate \(c\), we just
        start at the first vertex in \(c\) and iterate over it, adding up the
        lengths until there are no more vertices in \(c\). If this is less than
        \(k\), then we accept, else we reject. Thus since this is polynomially
        verifiable, \(TSP \in NP\).
        \\

        Now to prove that \(TSP\) is \(NP\)-complete, we need to show that
        a problem that is \(NP\)-complete can be polynomially reduced to it.
        We will now show that \(HAMPATH \leq_p TSP\).
        \\

        To do the reduction, we need to have a polynomial time computable
        function. We will construct a TM \(M\) that computes the function.


        \(M = \)`` On input string \(\langle G, s, t \rangle\) where \(G\) is a graph and \(s\) and \(t\) are vertices:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Check that the given input is a valid encoding of a Hamilton
                path from \(s\) to \(t\).
            \item Start with \(k = 0\).
            \item Iterate over the Hamilton path from \(s\) to \(t\), add one
                to \(k\) each time.
            \item Output \(\langle G, k \rangle\) where \(k\) is our newly
                computed value.''
        \end{enumerate}

        This works as a reduction because we are assigning a \(k\) value based on
        the input received from 

    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove that a language is in \(co-NP\) iff it has a polynomial time disqualifier.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that a language in \(coNP\) iff it has a polynomial time disqualifier, we
        will break it up and prove it in two parts.
        \\

        \textbf{Part One} If a language \(L \in coNP\), then it has a polynomial time disqualifier.
        \\

        \begin{proof}
            Suppose \(L\) is in \(coNP\). This means that its complement,
            \(\overline{L}\) is in \(NP\).  Since \(\overline{L}\) is in
            \(NP\), there exists a verifier \(V\) that can confirm that a given
            instance is accepted in polynomial time. Given this verifier, we
            can now construct a disqualifier \(D\) for \(L\) to shot that \(L
            \in coNP\).
            \\

            \(D = \)`` On input \(w\)
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Run the verifier \(V\) on input \(w\).
                \item If \(V\) accepts, \(reject\).
                \item If \(V\) rejects, \(accept\).''
            \end{enumerate}

            Since \(V\) already runs in polynomial time, we can just use it
            to construct our disqualifier. Thus it has a polynomial time disqualifier.
        \end{proof}

        \textbf{Part Two} If a language \(L\) has a polynomial time disqualifier, then \(L \in coNP\).
        \\

    \begin{proof}
        
    \end{proof}
