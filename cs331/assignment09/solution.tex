\begin{homeworkProblem}
    \textbf{Part A} Prove that \(n! \in O(n^n)\).
    \\

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(n! \in O(n^n)\), we will use the definition of big-O
        which states: For two functions, \(f\) and \(g\). Say that \(f(n) =
        O(g(n))\) if positive integers \(c\) and \(n_0\) exist such that for
        every integer \(n \geq n_0\) that \(f(n) \leq cg(n)\).
        \\

        Thus we need to find a \(c\) and \(n_0\) to satisfy the above
        condition.
        \\

        Let \(f(n) = n! \) and \(g(n) = n^n\). Let \(c = 1\) and \(n_0 = 1\), so for
        all \(n \geq n_0\) we have:

        \[
            \begin{split}
                n! &= (n)(n - 1)(n - 2)\hdots(2)(1)
                \\
                &\leq c(n_n)(n_{n-1})(n_{n-2})\hdots(n_{2})(n_{1})
                \\
                &= cn^n
            \end{split}
        \]

        Since we have satisfied the definition of big-O, we can see that \(n!
        \in O(n^n)\) and thus our proof is complete.
    \end{proof}

    \textbf{Part B} Which of the following relations is true and which is false?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(n \in O((\lg n)^3)\)
            \\
            \textbf{False}
            \\

            Linear functions outgrow polylogrithmic asymptotically.
        \item \((\lg n)^3 \in o(n)\)
            \\
            \textbf{True}
            \[
                \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(\lg n)^3}{n} = 0
            \]
        \item \(n^{\lg n} \in O(2^{n \lg n})\)
            \\
            \textbf{True | False}
        \item \(n^4 \in o(100n^4)\)
            \\
            \textbf{False}
            \[
                    \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^4}{100n^4}
                    = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{100}
                    = \frac{1}{100}
            \]
        \item \((\lg n)^n \in O(\sqrt{2^n})\)
            \\
            \textbf{True | False}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove that any language in \(P\) is \textbf{polynomial reducible} to any
    language in \(P\) which is not \(\emptyset\) or \(\Sigma^*\).

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that any language in \(P\) is polynomial reducible to any
        other language in \(P\), we will do a proof by construction to
        construct a polynomial time mapping function \(f\) that maps one
        language to another.
        \\

        Let there be two languages \(A\) and \(B\) that are both in \(P\).
        Since they are in \(P\) we know there are two TMs that run in
        polynomial time. Let these TMs be \(M_1\) and \(M_2\).
        \\

        We will now construct a polynomial reducible function where \(w \in A \iff f(w) \in B\).
        Let this function be computed by a TM \(N\) which is as follows:

        \(N = \)`` On input \(\langle M, w \rangle\) where \(M\) is a TM and \(w\) a string:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Construct a new TM, \(M'\):
                \(M' = \)`` On input \(w\):
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item TODO
                    \item Simulate \(M_2\) on newly computed value outputting what \(M_2\) does
                \end{enumerate}
            \item Output \(\langle M' \rangle\).''
        \end{enumerate}

        As we can see, since \(A\) and \(B\) are both in \(P\), we can use the TMs
        that recognize the languages because

    Let \(L = \{0^i 1^j : i > j\}\). Show that \(L \in TIME(n \lg n)\).

    \begin{proof}
        To show that \(L \in TIME(n \lg n)\), we will use a proof by construction to construct
        a new TM \(M\) that only uses \(TIME(n \lg n)\) steps to complete.
        \\

        \(M = \)`` On input string \(w\):

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove that the class \(P\) is closed under union and complementation.
    \\

    \textbf{Part One} Prove that \(P\) is closed under union.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(P\) is closed under union, we assume that there are two languages
        \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) with \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) as TMs that decide them.
        \\

        Assume that \(M_1\) runs in polynominal time, \(O(n^x)\) as well as
        \(M_2\), \(O(n^y)\).
        \\

        We will construct a new TM \(M\) that runs both \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) and show that it still
        runs in polynomial time.
        \\

        \(M = \)`` On input \(w\):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Run \(M_1\) on \(w\).
            \item Run \(M_2\) on \(w\).
            \item If one of the TMs accepted, accept, else reject.''
        \end{enumerate}

        The runtime of \(M\) can be determined as \(O(n^x) + O(n^y)\). Asymptotically,
        this is equal to the following: \(O(n^{z})\) where \(z = max(x, y)\).
        \\

        Thus we can see that P is closed under union.
    \end{proof}

    \textbf{Part Two} Prove that \(P\) is closed under complementation.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(P\) is closed under complementation, we assume that there is a
        language \(L\) with a TM \(M\) that decides it.
        \\

        Assume that \(M\) runs in polynominal time, \(O(n^x)\).
        \\

        We will construct a new TM \(N\) that runs \(M\) and we will
        show that it still runs in polynomial time.
        \\

        \(N = \)`` On input \(w\):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Run \(M\) on \(w\).
            \item If \(M\) accepted, reject, else accept.''
        \end{enumerate}

        The construction of \(N\) is such that it decides the complement of the
        language that \(M\) decides. This TM also runs in \(O(n^x)\), which
        means it still runs in polynomial time.
        \\

        Thus we can see that P is closed under complementation.

    \end{proof}
