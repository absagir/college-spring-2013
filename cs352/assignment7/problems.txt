1. (70pts) Develop a monitor in C (using pthread library functions) or Jave to solve the producer-consumer problem. [Hint: your program can be cased on the pseudo-code on Page 7 of 2013-3-4's lecture]


2. (30pts) Modify the monitor pseudo-code for the reader-writer problem on Page 8 of 2013-3-4's lecture to solve the "writer's priority" version of the problem defined as follows:

(1) At any time, the shared file can be accessed by one writer exclusively, or one or multiple readers concurrently.

(2) Whenever there are both reader and writer processes arriving or waiting to access the shared file, a writer has higher priority than reader to acess the shared file.
